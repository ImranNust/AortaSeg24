<h2>About the Challenge</h2>

This challenge focuses on proposing deep learning models for the segmentation of the Aorta, its branches, and zones. We provide an [example script](https://github.com/ImranNust/AortaSeg24_Duplicate/tree/main/training) utilizing [SwinUNETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01266) to guide you in developing your training script and training a module. Additionally, [sample validation code](https://github.com/ImranNust/AortaSeg24_Duplicate/tree/main/validation) is available to assess your proposed model's performance. Finally, a container submission script is offered to facilitate the submission process to the Grand Challenge. Feel free to modify this script to suit your specific needs.
